% Control processor - send code to each worker processor

% Core 1 starts at index 0
% Core 2 starts at index 40
% Core 3 starts at index 78
% Core 4 starts at index 88

Instead of working out how to get four processors to connect to the same memory,
it may be easier to make a new code loader which allows both code and data to go
into the same memory.
