A program representing the zigzag ordering of the JPEG entropy coding section.

The cluster receives the location in memory at which the block starts, and then
reads and forwards the data in a particular order to another cluster.

The data file contains sequential data in the order:
    0   1   2   ...
    8   9   10  ...
    16  17  18  ...
    ... ... ... ...
    
Data should be read in the order:
    0   1   8   16  9   2   ... 61  54  47  55  62  63
    
The file 12.loki contains a standard implementation of the sequence. It is quite
inefficient and has a lot of control flow, but this is useful for testing
purposes.

12_2.loki contains a slightly modified version which should be more tolerant of
memory or network latency. The cluster forwards the previous value when it
requests a new value, meaning there is a whole loop iteration for the data to
arrive.

The file 12_fast.loki offers a much more time-efficient implementation at the
expense of slight code expansion. Each data element is loaded directly, instead
of having its index computed.
