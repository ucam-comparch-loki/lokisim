A program representing the zigzag ordering of the JPEG entropy coding section.

The cluster receives the location in memory at which the block starts, and then
reads and forwards the data in a particular order to another cluster.

The data file contains sequential data in the order:
    0   1   2   ...
    8   9   10  ...
    16  17  18  ...
    ... ... ... ...
    
Data should be read in the order:
    0   1   8   16  9   2   ... 61  54  47  55  62  63
