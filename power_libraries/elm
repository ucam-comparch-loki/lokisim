% Energy figures extracted from James Balfour's PhD thesis at 
% http://cva.stanford.edu/publications/2010/jbalfour-thesis.pdf
%
% The figures were generated using a 45nm low-leakage CMOS process, at 1.1V.
%
% Note that there is only a 16 bit multiplier, and that the memory accesses
% assume that there are cache tags.
%
% All figures are in femtojoules.
